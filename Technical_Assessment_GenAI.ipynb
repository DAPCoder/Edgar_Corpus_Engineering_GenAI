      "Item 1 Investing in Digital Skills With a continued focus on digital transformation, Microsoft is making efforts to help ensure that no one is left behind, particularly as economies start to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are expanding access to the digital skills that have become increasingly vital to many of the world’s jobs, and especially to individuals hardest hit by recent job losses, including those with lower incomes, women, and underrepresented minorities. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. This is combined with $20 million we are investing in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies. OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.
